I was able to complete the whole lab and print all the correct output.
The part I struggled most with was trying to write my function with
as few if else statements as possible to keep it neat and concise.
I was able to complete task 1 with no if else staements, but for task 2 
I had to have 3 if else statements to make it work.

Task 1 Input
(205, 96, 144) = The color is reddish.
(28, 134, 238) = The color is bluish.
(72, 209, 204) = The color is greenish.
(237, 145, 33) = The color is reddish.

Task 2 Input
(250, 250, 70) = The color is a shade of yellow.
(245, 50, 245) = The color is a shade of magenta.
(100, 231, 231) = The color is a shade of cyan.
